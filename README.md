Summary of the project: This project is aimed to analyse customer data from a retail store to segment customers by considering various factors such as annual income and spending score/ purchasing behaviour. By identifying these segments, we can upskill the satisfaction and growth business by promoting the products to the customers who have high spending score. Using the dataset, we have done data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), K-Means clustering, and visualizations using matplotlib and Power BI.

Objectives: The primary objective of this project is to analyse customer data from a retail store and segment customers into various groups based on the purchase behaviour. By identifying these segments, the owner can make better marketing strategies to promote the products to customers groups on the basis of most purchased category of products which ultimately leads in the enhancement of engagement with customers and growth in sales.

Outcomes: Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of customer relationship management (CRM) and marketing strategies. In the context of a retail store, understanding different segments of customers lead to:
	Develop targeted marketing campaigns: Promote and advertise to specific customer groups on the basis of purchasing habits and category preference.
	Personalise customer experience: Offering personalised recommendations and services to improve loyalty and customer engagement.
	Optimise product offerings: Adjust inventory and product offerings to align with the different customer segments’ preferences.
	Increase customer retention: Implementing strategies to retain high-value customers and reduce churn rates.
	Enhance sales and revenue: Identify opportunities for cross-selling and up-selling to maximize sales and revenue.

By leveraging customer segmentation, the retail store can implement more effective marketing strategies, improve operational efficiency, and ultimately achieve a competitive advantage in the market.
